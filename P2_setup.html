    <div class="header">2: Up running - getting an environment</div>
    The next sections are about installing Node, NPM, Atom and Chrome plugins and getting to a position where we are ready to
    start developing web-pages with React. Complicated? - no - not at all. 
    <p/> 
    And if you want to skip it all, and just check it out in a click, go <a href="https://codesandbox.io" target="_blank" >here.</a> 
    Here you can try coding in React and see the result immediately. All on the web!
            
    <div class="title">Installing Node and NPM</div>
    NPM is actually installed along with Node. Therefore go here and have both installed: 
    <a href= "https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"> NodeJS + NPM</a>
    <p/> 
    <div class="title">Installing Atom</div>
    Install... and that should be it: <a href= "https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom IDE</a>
    <p/> 
    <div class="title">Plugin for Chrome</div>
    Go to <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Webstore</a>  
    Search for 'React Developer Tools'. And then 'Add'.
    <p/> 
    Thats it!
    <p/> 
    Next we will be putting up a project - with its filestructure and all. 
    There is more to it than just putting it all into a single index.html-file, as we did earlier. Much more.
