    <h3>Up running - getting an environment</h3>
    The next sections are about installing Node, NPM, Atom and Chrome plugins and getting to a position where we are ready to
    start developing web-pages with React. Complicated? - no - not at all.
    <p/> 
    <b>Installing Node and NPM</b> <br/>
    NPM is actually installed along with Node. Therefore go here and have both installed: 
    <a href= "https://nodejs.org/en/"> NodeJS + NPM</a>
    <p/> 
    <b>Installing Atom</b><br/>
    Install... and that should be it: <a href= "https://atom.io/">Atom IDE</a>
    <p/> 
    <b>Plugin for Chrome</b><br/>
    Go to <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome Webstore</a>  
    Search for 'React Developer Tools'. And then 'Add'.
    <p/> 
    Thats it!
    <p/> 
    Next we will be putting up a project - with its filestructure and all. 
    There is more to it than just putting it all into a single index.html-file, as we did earlier. Much more.
