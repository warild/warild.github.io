<body><h3>Structure of the project</h3>
	What about the folderstructure in react-projects? Some structure is needed, but no structure is predefined.
	<p/>
	<b>The single page approach</b><br/>
	We started by showing that it all could go into one single html-file.
	Done this way the browser traverses the file and finds instructions to fetch the React-library from a Facebook location. 
	Then the React-code in the html is transformed into JavaScript that is understandable to the browser. Finally the browser 
	renders this transformed code and the page is shown to the user. 
	<p/>
	This is too easy. And gets too complicated when the app grows.
	<p/>
	<b>The template approach</b><br/>
	Someone has been down this road before, making the 'create-react-app' package. By running this a readymade startup 
	project is created. And you just continue your work based on this. How to install and run?
	<p/>
	Download: <br/>
	<i>npm install -g create-react-app</i>
	<p/>
	Create project. <br/>
	Go to the folder where you want the folder of the project created, and then issue this command (with the name of the new project):<br/>
	<i>create-react-app Name_of_the_new_project </i>
	<p/>
	Start the Node-webserver <br/>
	Go into the folder with the new project, and the issue the command to start the server:<br/>
	<i>npm start</i>
	<p/>
	The template web-page should now show in the browser.
	<p/>
	But there at things of importance to notice: With this approach the index.html must always exist, and it must always 
	be placed in the 'public' -folder. The file 'index.js' must also exist, and it must always be placed in the 'src'-folder. 
	This is because the system uses this index.html to start the app and always inspects this index.js for the content 
	of the app. 
	<p/>
	This predecision is the (minor) drawback of this approach. Single command is the (mayor) benefit.
	<p/>
	
	<b>The on your own approach</b><br/>
	This approach gives you the freedom to chose structure yourself. And change it underways as you reaches new insights.
