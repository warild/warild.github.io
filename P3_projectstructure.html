      <h3>Unveiling relationships - React, Redux and Less</h3>
    Less first. Less is CSS with the addition of variables, functions and others, adding a layer above CSS, 
    simplifying and clarifying the CSS-code. 
    Redux takes care of state when an event occurs, ensuring consistency of data within the app.
    <p/>
    The MVC world is related to the 3 layer structure in the following way: The Model relates to the datacontent 
    of the webpage, the View relates to the CSS and the Controller relates to JavaScript. What is not mentioned, 
    but completes the picture is that there is a relation between structure and the html-code. 
    <p/> 
    This brings us to the transformation of the consepts into the React world. The Model and data relates to Redux 
    (changing of state). The View and CSS relate to Less. This could be taken further into Materialized design and 
    responsible design, but not for now. Controller and JavaScript relates 
    to JavaScript. And finally React relates to the structure and html. 
    <p/> 
    With these distinctions it might get easier to work in the new world - it is not that new - the elements are the same,
    just having new names and are positioned differently - more browser orientet, and expressed i JavaScript.
