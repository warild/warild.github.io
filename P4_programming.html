<h3>On programming with React</h3>
  Programming means coding, but first a view at a distance: <br/>
  A layer is added above the traditional content of html-files. The layer is JavaScript and this gives us the freedom we get 
  when coding. This means that the html in the file is controlled by JavaScript, the CSS is controlled by javaScript, and the 
  actions and events are controlle by JavaScript.
  <p/>
  In other words: By adding a layer of coding we get more freedom when creating dynamic web-applications!
  <p/>
  How is this done? - First html
  <p/>
  <b>JSX</b><br/>
  In JavaScript you will have to write something like <code>.innerHtml("<div>Here, within quotation-marks, are my html.</div>");
  </code>
  Not easy to debug, not easy for an IDE to intellisense or to give you the kind of support you might have experienced else where.
  <p/>
  The JSX to rescue. With JSX you can write - or more precisely: program html. Complicated? New programminglanguage to learn?
  No - it looks like traditional html-tags. But in addition you can make your own tags - those tags beeing variabels, 
  functions or classes. 
  <p/>
  <b>Variables</b><br/>
  In other words, your own defined tag, like  &le; MyTag &gt; can be a variable replacing MyTag vith the 
  value of the function. If MyVariabel = "bla bla html"; the final html will contain the "bla bla".
  <p/>
  <b>Functions</b><br/>
  A function may be defined in its own file like this:
  function MyFunction(var){ "some tag" + var;}
  <p/>
  The function may take variables, generating different htmls, like this: 'bla bla' or like this 'bla bl√¶'.
  It is in the html, looks like html, but is a function that generates html. Meaning you can think and see html-tags as you 
  overlook your page. You see  only tags at one side, and only JavaScript on an other side.
  <p/>
  <b>Classes</b><br/>
  The html may also be generated by a class. A class must implement a certain interface. The most notable function here is the 
  render() -function. This function is called when the class is rendered and the html is created. 
  Classes may contain user defined functions as well. 
  <p/>
  JavaScript has the possibility to use named varables as parameters. You see the resemblance between these lines of html 
  and of a function: <br/>
  html name="Bill" message="hi you" <br/>
  function doSomething(name="Bill" message="hi you")
  <p/>
  In other words, JSX may look like html, but is is JavaScript converting your JSX into html that can be rendered by browsers.
  <p/>
  Benefits: Reuse of components. Hiding complexity. And more is to come.
  <p/>
  But there are more to note: In a multipage webapp the state is updated whenever a new page is requested or reloaded. 
  Hence it is not necessary to pay spesific attention to the updating of data. Not so in a singlepage app. 
  <p/>
  <b>State - what to do where when data changes</b><br/>
  What should happen in the webapp when a change - like a mouseClick occurs? You will have to decide which values should
  be updated and which components should be rendered. 
  <p/>
  To make a distinction between values that stay the same, and which properties are subject to changes react has two 
  collections: this.props - for data that does not change, and this.state for data that changes.
  <p/>
  <b>Variables - maintaining state</b><br/>
  <p/>
  
  <p/>
  This was a short intro to the way React takes your "html" written in JSX and turns it into ordinar html.
  <b>CSS</b><br/>
  What about CSS? With LESS variables and functions are introduced, making it easy to reuse the same property in different 
  styles. How it looks?
  <p/>
  A css-variable is defined teh following way: @Var = "background: #fff;" or @White = "#ddd;" and is utilized the following 
  way: body {@var; border: @White}
