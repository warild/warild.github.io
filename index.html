    <h1>Learning React - a journey</h1>
    <div>What is react? - It is something very different from what I thought when I was introduced to it</div> 
    <p/>
      Here are keypoints from my journey into learning React, and it might be interesting to others as well
    
    <h3>React is not alone !</h3>
    Other names continued to pop-up as I was trying to find what React really did. 
    Names like Node, WebPack, Flux, Redux, MaterialUI etc. 
    How much noise.
    <p/>
    The case is, React is only a part of the system. We need other parts as well. 
    How is the system made up and where does the parts fit in? And what system are we talking of?
    
    <h3>SPA - Single Page Application</h3>
    I ended up here, with SPA at the real starting point. 
    <p/>
    SPA -Single page Application -  is one single dynamic interactive web-page. When hit, all content of the page is downloaded. 
    Then javascript is used to change layout and update the page according to userinteractions. 
    <p/>
    This is the startingpoint: Javascript used to create an application. And this changes the commom understanding of a client server application.
    The task of the client is to display the pages created and sent by the server. Not now anymore.
    <p/>
    With SPA the client holds the logic and servers - there can be more than one - are supporting the SPA with services and repos.
    <p/>
    This is the startingpoint: We want to make a SPA - and therefore we are interested i React - and other tools.
