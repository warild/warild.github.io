    <h1>Learning React - a journey</h1>
    <div>What is react? - It is something very different from what I thought at start</div> 
    <p/>
      Here are keypoints from my journey into learning React.
    
    <h3>React is not alone !</h3>
    Other names continued to pop-up as I was trying to find out what React really was. 
    Names like Node, WebPack, Flux, Redux, MaterialUI etc. 
    How much noise.
    <p/>    
    The case is, React is only a part of a system. We need them other parts as well. 
    
    <h3>Searching for a starting point</h3>
    React is part of a system. What kind of system are we talking of? How is the system made up and how are the parts related? 
    
    <h3>Single Page Application</h3>
    I ended up here, with Single Page Application as the real starting point. 
    <p/>
    A Single Page Application is an application running in a single web-page. The page is dynamic and interactive 
    and JavaScript is used to make things happen there. With javaScript the layout is changed, data is fetched and 
    the user is navitated to new layouts whithin the same web-page.
    <p/>
    Traditionally we have a client-server paradigm where the task of the client is to display the pages created and
    sent by the server. Not so in this case.
    <p/>
    With SPA we need to rethink this consept. Now the client holds the logic and it is the client that makes contact 
    with servers and repos - and there can be more than one server and repo.
    <p/>
    With SPA there is one issue with search engines. Search engines do not look into your JavaScript generated application.
    They will not find what is embedded in your page. If this is what you want - make a SPA. But if you have information 
    that should be searchable - use a traditional solution. We are setting for a SPA.
